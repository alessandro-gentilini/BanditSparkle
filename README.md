**Abstract:** Stellar oscillations are stochastically driven high-Q modes. If a star is observed through an observing campaign that is shorter than the coherence time of a mode, the mode will effectively appear coherent within that time interval. Here we exploit this to create an inexpensive probabilistic model for asteroseismology data. The huge advantage of this approach to traditional asteroseismology approaches is that it does not require the performance of a fourier transform or anything like it; this permits the measurement of asteroseismic parameters in data sets that are irregularly or sparsely sampled, or in data sets where the critical modes are near the edges of the available frequency space (near the inverse exposure time at the high-frequency end or near the inverse of the duration of the campaign at the low-freqency end). It also permits the execution of a justifiable likelihood function, even when the noise processes are non-trivial....
